## About

*Bean and Nothingness* is a puzzle game designed by a team of mathematicians. Beans transform into monsters which you must create, manipulate, and destroy in the right places and at the right times; they can both help you and get in the way as you try to solve each puzzle. Explore and exploit the behavior of nine different monsters across over 250 challenging, hand-crafted puzzles.

Bean and Nothingness is a real-time, 2-D, tile-based puzzle game. It looks kind of like this:

The puzzles are built around the behavior of the nine types of monsters. The monsters are created by the player out of combinations of beans — the exact beans required to make each monster depends on the puzzle you’re playing — and each one behaves in a unique but predictable way. (For example, the orange dinosaur up there in the corner will run at the main character whenever it sees her, and the sleeping yellow thing below it can explode when it’s pushed.) The monsters interact with the player, the beans, and each other, and most puzzles involve understanding and exploiting these interactions to get to the end without being stampeded, eaten, zapped, drowned, frozen, or blown up.
