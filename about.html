## About

*Bean and Nothingness* is a puzzle game designed by a team of mathematicians. Beans transform into monsters which you must create, manipulate, and destroy in the right places and at the right times; they can both help you and get in the way as you try to solve each puzzle. Explore and exploit the behavior of nine different monsters across over 250 challenging, hand-crafted puzzles.
