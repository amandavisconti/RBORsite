<b>Bean and Nothingness</b> is a 2-D, tile-based puzzle game in which you wield a wand that can turn beans into monsters, based on recipes that vary from puzzle to puzzle. You must create, manipulate, and destroy these monsters in the right places and at the right times; they can both help you and hinder you as you try to solve each puzzle.
