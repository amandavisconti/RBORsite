<P>
*Bean and Nothingness* is a 2-D, tile-based puzzle game in which you wield a wand that can turn beans into monsters, based on recipes that vary from puzzle to puzzle. You must create, manipulate, and destroy these monsters in the right places and at the right times; they can both help you and hinder you as you try to solve each puzzle.
In the game, you'll explore and exploit the behavior of eight different monsters across over 150 challenging, hand-crafted puzzles, navigating an ancient temple and uncovering its mysteries, all while avoiding being stampeded, eaten, zapped, drowned, frozen, or blown up.
